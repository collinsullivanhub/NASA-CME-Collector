A coronal mass ejection is a significant release of plasma and accompanying magnetic field from the solar corona.
They often follow solar flares and are normally present during a solar prominence eruption.
The plasma is released into the solar wind, and can be observed in coronagraph imagery.

The Large Angle and Spectrometric coronagraph (LASCO) instrument is one of eleven instruments included on the joint NASA/ESA Solar and Heliospheric Observatory spacecraft. This instrument uses a laser array which measure these solar ejections.

This tool was built for educational purposes to gather data about coronal mass ejections over a given time span.
